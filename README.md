Being partially complete, this project was supposed to replace the current checkout process that can be found in major retail stores. 
I had the intentions of putting the checkout counter on the shopping cart itself. It would be more convenient to scan items while putting them in the cart. 
I used a RFID RC-522 scanner to read the UID tags on various cards in which I assigned prices to specific tags. 
I then used the LCD to display the total (a simple count function did the trick). The idea is relatively simple. 



I will have to order a barcode scanner so that I can improve the current model to scan any existing package that can be found in a generic retail store. 
It would also be better to use a raspberry pi so that I can use it for internet connectivity/mongoDB. 
Implementing a touch screen with the raspberry pi would also be great for user interface. An updated version of the project will be posted soon.
